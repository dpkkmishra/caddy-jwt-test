## Contributor License Agreements

I'd love to accept your pull request! Before I can take them, we have to jump a
couple of legal hurdles.

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have
signed the CLA can be accepted into the main repository.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the
  intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](/assets/cla/individual_cla.md).
* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then
  you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](/assets/cla/corporate_cla.md).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA. Next, if you are
ready to accept, add the following text in the body your first commit message.

* For Individual CLA:

      I hereby consent to the Individual CLA provided in assets/cla/individual_cla.md

* For Corporate CLA:

      I hereby consent to the Corporate CLA provided in assets/cla/corporate_cla.md
